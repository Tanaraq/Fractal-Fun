# Fractal-Fun

## Description ##

*I've always been fascinated by fractals!*\
Being able to write a program that draws them makes me proud and happy! 
I added a little menu where you can manually adjust the fractals parameters. 

## Languages used: ##

HTML, CSS and lots of JavaScript

## What I learned from this project: ##

* the basics of canvas 
* writing JS functions with intricate loops
* working with lots of variables that can be randomized or manually adjusted
* creating HTML forms with corresponding eventListeners and eventHandler functions
